        labels: ["But I don't see that—","Here—take this chair.—And now?","And you said nothing?","Slept well?","Isn't it strange—? The more I think of it now the more it seems to me as though I had gone about all these years torturing myself with—h'm—","Have you finished the letter already Miss Fosli?","When was that?","You were thoroughly comfortable then?","Was that a great misfortune for you?","No it was burnt down.","And often and often I have to remind myself that it was a righteous punishment for me—","I thought so.","Was that why?","Won't you sit down?","And it was?","Very well indeed. Princess Hilda of—of—what was to be the name of the kingdom?","With the effort to recover something—some experience which I seemed to have forgotten. But I never had the least inkling of what it could be.","And did not think of repairing the flue either?","Of course your son will stay with me as long as ever he likes.","Good evening!","I almost believe you don't recognise me!","But I recognise you my dear young lady—","Of course it is.","Dear Mrs. Solness—tell me what things you mean!","But I can tell you nothing came of that!","Yes of both kinds. Oh no he made me feel clearly enough that he was not pleased with me.","In that case I should simply have had to go racking my brains to discover what the knot could mean.","Not always I am sorry to say. I know well enough that it is my duty—but all the same I cannot.","Oh that I always do. Good-night my dear little Kaia.","Oh you didn't like that Miss Hilda?","Then you are—ill after all Halvard.","And now we well write on the drawings. We must write very very nicely and cordially—for this horrid Ruar—or whatever his name is.","I have one here.","And no doubt you dreamed too.","Was it?","Ah! now it grows light.","Good night then.","Halvard I cannot keep the doctor any longer.","A debt to me?","You may go now Miss Fosli. And please come in good time to-morrow morning.","Are you in a hurry doctor?","If you have been waiting for me all these ten years—","Yes it was quite a short one.","So we were.","No no no! That was just what I did not want.","Have you never really cared for any one Hilda?","For any one else yes. Have you never? In all these ten years? Never?","May I have a little chat with you?","Just sit down again Hilda and I'll tell you something funny.","And I am afraid it can't be denied that you flirted a little with us.","All of them. Oh it was hard—so hard for me.","No that is just the heartbreaking part of it—I have begun to have my doubts about the boy. For you have never said so much as—as one encouraging word about him. And yet I cannot but think there must be something in him—he can't be without talent.","Almost irresistible—quite irresistible. For at that time it appeared to me a perfectly simple and straightforward matter. I would have had it happen in the winter-time—a little before midday. I was to be out driving Aline in the sleigh. The servants at home would have made huge fires in the stoves.","What if they do? Then there's an end of Halvard Solness.","What do you mean?","The longing to see you great. To see you with a wreath in your hand high high up upon a church-tower.","Yes I shall love to sit and listen to you.","He does not need me any more.","Quite right Miss Wangel. It is wonderful how all these trifles have impressed themselves on your mind.","It seems to make one's blood run cold.","Just go in there for moment Kaia.","Yes yes you did!","First of all I searched and tried my own heart—","He pleased with me! How can you talk so Hilda? He who gave the troll in me leave to lord it just as it pleased. He who bade them be at hand to serve me both day and might—all these—all these—","What a good thing it is that you have come to me now.","Did I really.","She is. And as we drove home we were to see the smoke.","Yes you see—circumstances favoured me.","Tell me Miss Wangel—what is your name? Your Christian name I mean.","Well that I think that he ought to have been pleased with me.","Yes I have just arrived.","Why I should say he was very well off here. But if he wants more money I should not mind—","Well now for the crack in the chimney!","And then all the dolls.","What became of the other ladies?","Yes you have been looking very poorly of late.","Oh yes—with what you call domestic comfort—and that sort of thing.","But why did you keep putting it off like that?","It came too late.","Yes long after that.","Aline and I lived there in the first years of our married life. There was an old house up there that had belonged to her mother and we inherited it and the whole of the great garden with it.","No I suppose I did not.","Well but—","Do you really mean that?","Yes—Kaia.","Yes yes yes that might very will have happened too. For one of those white-frocked little devils—she went on in such a way and screamed up at me so—","—they—oh!","Little children do grow quickly at first.","This is very strange—all this.","Well and what then—?","Oh yes do remind me a little of that too.","Ah yes those flags—I can tell you I remember them!","The builder—he will come.","Have you brought the wreath Ragnar?","After this day we two will build together Hilda.","Castles in the air yes! Do you know what sort of thing a castle in the air is?","Builders—they are such very—very stupid people.","Sung? Did I sing?","I am sure of that now. It must have been you.","No no no! The younger generation—it means retribution you see. It comes as if under a new banner heralding the turn of fortune.","No no of course not! You don't understand me either.","Yes for now I see it. Men have no use for these homes of theirs—to be happy in. And I should not have had any use for such a home if I had had one.","At what?","Oh you dear Mrs. Solness! You are really much too kind to me! Frightfully kind—","Oh how very very kind of you!","She has not got over it to this day—not in all these twelve or thirteen years.","I can tell you it is—when one has so many faults as I have—","Poor fellow there is surely no fear of that. If he has nothing in him—","Yes yes—good-night then.","Crush you? Has he the ability for that?","Oh yes!","He has the chance of a capital commission at this very moment. A big bit of work.","Oh yes indeed. So long as he did not see it—. But they were all burnt up poor things. No one thought of saving them. Oh it is so miserable to think of. You mustn't laugh at me Miss Wangel.","I must go into town now Halvard.","For yourself?","Was that all you meant when you said you need me?","And so both of them—? You have lost both the twins then?","A high tower?","No on the contrary—I am perfectly certain that the crack in the chimney had nothing whatever to do with the fire.","It has been clearly ascertained that the fire broke out in a clothes-cupboard—in a totally different part of the house.","You know that I began by building churches.","For you see I came as a boy from a pious home in the country and so it seemed to me that this church-building was the noblest task I could set myself.","The younger generation!","I you would give your consent.","Yes everything that was mine was burnt.","Yes yes Miss Wangel for it is only my duty to submit myself to him. But very often it is dreadfully difficult to force one's mind to obedience.","Pooh—is the younger generation something to be afraid of?","It was the home of Aline's family. Remember that.","Yes you can indeed! For you too come—under a new banner it seems to me. You marshalled against youth—!","Debt do you say? But you owe no one anything Halvard!","Ho-ho-ho! It's natural enough Aline! When you have a sick man on your hands—","Then I'll give this to her and tell her that—","H'm—","Then you will never build anything more?","Then let us sit down.","Is that all? I have noticed that myself.","Then you did take an interest in other people too?","Then call to some one!","Mr. Solness is dead!","A half-mad man then! A crazy man! Call me what you will.","What is behind all this? You may just as well tell me at once.","And mind you get that matter settled for me. Do you hear?","What is her name?","The I did the impossible—I no less than he.","Well Miss Wangel your room is quite ready for you now.","Here are all the drawings.","I am afraid you would turn dizzy before we got half-way up.","Hilda—take those devil's drawings out of my sight!","Don't you agree with me Hilda that there exist special chosen people who have been endowed with the power and faculty if desiring a thing craving for a thing willing a thing—so persistently and so—so inexorably—that at last it has to happen? Don't you believe that?","Afraid of falling down and killing yourself?","Then I daresay you fancy that I am an extremely happy man.","He is so kind and gentle in reality.","Don't talk like that! Do you want to kill me? To take from me what is more than my life?","Oh yes—now and then—","No no one.","For I have been so lonely here. I have been gazing so helplessly at it all.","No more than that?","You had learned little enough of the business when you were in my employment. But that did not prevent you from setting to work—","I had nine lovely dolls.","They didn't much like all the fun we used to have in the evenings.","Couldn't you build a little—a little bit of a church-tower over these homes as well?","You said so yourself just now.","Worse?","The luck will turn. I know it—I feel the day approaching. Some one or other will take it into his head to say: Give me a chance! And then all the rest will come clamouring after him and shake their fists at me and shout: Make room—make room—! Yes just you see doctor—presently the younger generation will come knocking at my door—","What in the world did I do next?","I think it is rather you I ought to thank.","You—Mr. Solness!","Hilda? Indeed?","That you are a little—a little mad after all.","Rather biting yes—and they would want Aline to find it thoroughly snug and warm when she came home.","He who was to have the churches of course! He to whose honour and glory they were dedicated.","From the day I lost them I had no heart for building churches.","Must you have that on the instant too?","I always did that in those days. It is an old custom.","Was it too much for them?","A tremendously high tower. And at the very top of the tower there shall be a balcony. And I will stand out upon it—","Well then you talk to me about it.","The real thing?","The poor little twins yes.","Oh yes he will! We two will set to work together. And then we will build the loveliest—the very loveliest—thing in all the world.","If possible.","Come here and let us sit down Hilda. Sit there on the sofa—so that you can look into the garden.","Yes after a good dinner one doesn't haggle about the halfpence. But did I really say all that?","Have you noticed Hilda that as soon as I come she goes?","Were you alone?","Oh safe—safe enough! That is not at all what I mean. Good lord—don't you understand me either?","She is sitting by his bed.","That must depend upon circumstances.","Do as I say child. And shut the door after you.","Well remain then since you are bent upon it.","Still in your mountaineering dress Miss Wangel?","No nothing of the kind. From the outside it looked like a great dark ugly wooden box but all the same it was snug and comfortable enough inside.","It is exactly ten years.","I may say such things—but you must not.","Ragnar—you must not ask me to do what is beyond my power! Do you hear Ragnar? You must not!","Only a little. We spent a few days together at the sanatorium.","They were very anxious to have the drawings at once.","Ah then I suppose you father is better?","I look so ugly with it on.","No no leave them here.","Yes to be sure it is! Castles in the air—they are so easy to build too—","How could you be so certain that I was not?","There is no one else.","No reason of any sort?","Yes father's alive.","But you succeeded all the same.","Are there nurseries in that house too?","Perhaps so. But I cannot help it.","And be sure you keep firm hold of him. I believe you can do it best.","Oh promise promise! One can promise anything.","They were immensely pleased with his idea. They thought it exceedingly original they said.","It seemed to them different.","Yes it is I Mr. Solness.","See her Kaia! You can take this home Mr. Solness was written on them now.","I know you have known a good many women in your time.","Then you will come in presently?","No that hadn't occurred to me.","I did!","For that among other things.","And no child.","Is that your new house?","No I won't say.","Now really my dear Miss Wangel—!","Yes I do. I deny it altogether!","It must be the wind in the tree-tops.","We were talking of these drawings—","That younger generation that you are so afraid of?","What did she say? I will know! At once! at once!","Kaia come in here! Make haste! Mr. Solness wants to speak to you.","Well now don't forget Halvard.","Well isn't it just as I said—?","To help him I thought.","And have been a good deal taken with some of them too.","Yes. If you would only look through them and approve of them—","Yes. You see he knows the family. And then—just for the fun of the thing—he has made drawings and estimates and so forth—","Say mad for that is what you mean.","Oh Halvard if I had only had the strength!","Yourself—!","That is what people call having the luck on your side but I must tell you what this sort of luck feels like! It feels like a great raw place here on my breast. And the helpers and servers keep on flaying pieces of skin off other people in order to close my sore!—But still the sore is not healed—never never! Oh if you knew how it can sometimes gnaw and burn!","You are mistaken.","Pooh that sounds so cold! Her Christian name I mean?","Almost—I was going to say.","Look look! Now he is waving his hat! He is waving it to us down here! Oh wave wave back to him! For now it is finished!","It is nice of you to be willing to sit with me. I thought you wanted to go in to my husband.","Mrs. Solness!","Yes by all means if you care to.","But then great heavens—!","Oh—that girl—that Kaia at the desk. Poor thing—don't you want to take her with you too?","Then I have my kingdom!","Yes on my soul she does! I tell you it is so. And she has got you to think the same! Oh I can assure you doctor I see it in your face as clearly as possible. You don't take me in so easily I can tell you.","Only with me? Will there be no others of the party?","Aline has made up her mind that I am mad. That is what she thinks.","She has begun to think that I am—that I am—ill.","Is it so—or is it not?","All these ten years I have believed in you so utterly—so utterly.","He will not either!","But if she is all that—what made her say that about her duty?","Yes exactly. Making fun—of both of us.","Yes in the devil's name! You said it so strangely—as if you had some hidden meaning in it.","Thanked him? Ought I to have thanked him?","I merely wished to let you know that I have come.","I will try to.","No no—of course not! Heaven forbid! Only think—to be Solness the master builder! Halvard Solness! What could be more delightful?","I won't hear anything more about those drawings of yours!","Don't think about that Aline!","What do you build then?","Even then—I might almost say—it can make no difference. I must keep Kaia Fosli. No one else could fill her place.","With what then? Out with it!","Well I was twelve or thirteen.","My castle shall stand on a height—on a very great height—with a clear outlook on all sides so that I can see far—far around.","Tell me Mr. Solness—are you certain that you have never called me to you? Inwardly you know?","Oh not in the least. Not more than usual at any rate. But all the same you had better go now Kaia.","What is it to be then?","A robust conscience.","Where do you keep your pen and ink?","Heavens! what deceitful eyes she has.","Oh how good you are to me! How unspeakably good you are!","Of what then?","But as regards Miss Fosli then? There is nothing of that sort in this case?","No I certainly have not.","I can't quite make you out Miss Wangel.","At me!","Nobody but you. And of course your wife.","Yes yes just give me a hint and then perhaps—— Well?","They say they are longing so to get into a house of their own.","The price Hilda! The terrible price I had to pay for the opportunity!","There he is coming.","No no don't go. Let us get it over.","Yes I know you have built a tremendous lot.","Yes there is something I must talk to you about.","It sounds so could and sharp and stinging. Duty—duty—duty. Don't you think so too? Doesn't it seem to sting you?","It's no light matter to owe you anything Hilda.","Yes I shall not easily forget that day.","You must surely be a very happy man as matters stand with you.","Why don't you call yourself an architect like the others?","Well?","The younger generation did come knocking at your door.","I believe I understand—","Yes do and come again later on.","What is that you are entering Miss Fosli?","And go home at once to your father.","What was she talking about Hilda?","Hard enough for me but ten time harder for Aline.","Because I want to look at them too.","Many times?","Comes well?","No that they did not get over. That was how we lost them.","You must help him to get some independent work now! I must see something that the lad has done. Do you hear?","But just now—when you said you thought I was—off my balance? In one thing you said—","For you see in a certain sense there was life in them too. I carried them under my heart—like little unborn children.","She will never get over it—never in this world.","Besides I know very little about these people as yet.","No. That I might build homes for others I had to forego—to forego for all time—the home that might have been my own. I mean a home for a troop of children—and for father and mother too.","I have no doubt you did Miss Wangel.—And besides—I was feeling so buoyant and free that day—","Dear dear—did I say that too?","I find it so pleasant and warm here to-day.","How do you know about that?","You are feeling very ill this evening are you not Uncle?","Oh no I suppose it is the troll within one that's responsible for that.","To me he very seldom mentions these things.—Yes I can tell you I have gone through more than enough trouble in my life Miss Wangel.","Don't move any of you! Not a sound!","Sit down and I will tell you something.","And kissed me?","That was the price of this happiness that people talk about.","But not such a good thing for me. For then I shall have nobody to help me.","But I believe she is soon going to be married.","Not about this. Not as I want to talk and must talk.","Yes yes my poor Aline. That was a terrible blow for you.","Oh Hilda I can't tell you what a good thing it is for me that you have come! For now at last I have some one to talk to!","You see they really are clever fellows these two. Each of them has talent in his own way. But then the son took it into his head to get engaged and the next thing of course was that he wanted to get married—and begin to build on his own account. That is the way with all these young people.","Is it she who wishes it?","Well you see—it is like paying off a little bit of a huge immeasurable debt—","Do you mean to say you don't find a kind of lurking hidden meaning in the most innocent word I happen to say?","He must turn now. He can't possibly help it.","Answer me Hilda. What do you want of me?","But in the office where that young lady is—","H'm—don't ask more just now.","Yes. We have had no end of things to talk about.","So I have. I can't complain on that score.","Then I will wave my hat—and come down to the earth—and do as I said to him.","Is it Miss Wangel you are sitting there thinking about?","Yes as high as ever I can.","The first man that came to hand? No thank you—that would never do for me.","Him too?","Oh yes please do!","In a certain sense he is cowardly—he the great master builder. He is not afraid of robbing others of their happiness—as he has done both for my father and me. But when it comes to climbing up a paltry bit of scaffolding—he will do anything rather than that.","That was the song that I heard through the air!","I did not see him take them with him.","Yes I suppose I ought to.","Because I seem to find a sort of—of salutary self-torture in allowing Aline to do me an injustice.","Have you really?","What was it?","Oh come now—I know what I know. I have both my eyes and my ears about me Aline—you may depend upon that!","Building homes for human beings—is not worth a rap Hilda.","—frightfully thrilling—","Yes. And then I will say to him: Now I shall go down and throw my arms round her and kiss her—","No no I suppose you are right there—and Aline too. But it's impossible to make any change.","You must pass out of life as best you can.","Yes I have been taking a look at it.","Hilda—what is it you have come for?","But he mounted right to the top. And I heard harps in the air.","I can't see him up there now.","Oh nonsense. Was anything wrong at home? Eh?","There we have it! There we have it Hilda! There is the troll in you too as in me. For it's the troll in one you see—it is that that calls to the powers outside us. And then you must give in—whether you will or no.","Then you know more than I do Hilda.","Not houses and towers and spires—not such things as I work away at—","Yes you may well say so Hilda.","I hear your father is no better?","Sit down now and rest a little.","Yes it is indeed.","—the castle on the table! It is my castle! I will have it at once!","There I entirely agree with you!","She will not be allowed to!","We will talk about that presently Hilda.","Some one is knocking at the door.","Through that little black crack in the chimney I might perhaps force my way upwards—as a builder.","May I go on talking to you a little Hilda?","Ah do you hear that Aline?","Yes indeed they will! You may be quite sure of that! For you see—there will be so very very much there that will remind you of your own home—","Oh—I can see what I can see Halvard.——Are you really dismissing them?","No doubt people will say it is too high—too high for a dwelling-house.","What did you want with me?","Just so. But of course that did not suit my plans for I needed Ragnar myself—and the old man too. He is exceedingly good at calculating bearing strains and cubic contents—and all that sort of devilry you know.","Of retribution?","My God! My God!","You may perhaps see something different this evening.","Many church-towers among the rest? Immensely high ones?","But confess now—you want to get married!","Don't say anything about my being here.","She said that she would go out and buy something for me because it was her duty. Oh I can't bear that ugly horrid word!","Could you come to love a man like that?","No they are drawn by a young man whom I employ to help me.","Peace of soul!","Was that all you wanted? To make fun of me?","No I can't make up my mind whether you mean all you say or are simply having a joke with me.","To somebody else? Are you prepared to give up the commission?","When she came with it he was unconscious. He had had a stroke.","I have just come up out of a tomb.","Castles in the air.","Let me look at it Miss Fosli.","I have never sung a note in my life.","Well leave them here then.","So your prediction has come true Mr. Solness!","Is he not coming soon?","Too late. These powers—these—these—","Mark what I say to you Hilda. All that I have succeeded in doing building creating—all the beauty security cheerful comfort—ay and magnificence too—","That was what occurred to me at first. But no that was not it. She seemed to drift quite away from him—when once she had come here to me.","That I turn dizzy?","Yes it must have been about that time. Fancy your remembering that too!","It was ten years ago—on the 19th of September.","Do you mean—because she has come here?","Yes believe me Aline—","Yes.","Oh yes! When I used to read books I—","It is surely not so hard for you. You have your duties to her. Live for those duties.","But he will not do it. He simply dare not do it. For you see he cannot get over this infirmity—master builder though he be.","Is it so or is it not?","Do you dream much of nights?","She drifted over to you then?","They did it for my happiness! Yes yes!","What do they want to look at him for?","That was most extraordinary.","That all this I have to make up for to pay for—not in money but in human happiness. And not with my own happiness only but with other people's too. Yes yes do you see that Hilda? That is the price which my position as an artist has cost me—and others. And every single day I have to look on while the price is paid for me anew. Over again and over again—and over again for ever!","Thank you Miss Wangel for having kept such a firm hold upon him. I should never have been able to manage him.","They want to see how he daren't climb to the top of his own house.","Yes yes Miss Wangel you know how to keep firm hold on a man when you give your mind to it.","I can't think otherwise. And surely you think so too?","Well well perhaps you are right.","No no no! Please God I shall never see that. I will write at once to the doctor—and I am sure he won't let you do it.","Or if one had a really vigorous radiantly healthy conscience—so that one dared to do what one would.","To carry off women eh?","No no don't think that!","About the very thing my mind had been fixed on. But I hadn't said one single word about it.","Promised you? Threatened I suppose you mean?","That emptiness is dreadful you are right there.","A stranger yes! for that is quite a different thing! A person I have never set eyes on. But one that I have come into close contact with—! Oh no! Oh no! Ugh!","Yes I daresay!","And now she is dead—for my sake. And I am chained alive to a dead woman.","I sha'n't tell you to-night. Another time perhaps.","For to-night yes. I shall not cry. I mean to sleep as sound as a stone.","Yes that is what you promised me.","Well but what about the other thing? That she believed I had said to her what I had only wished and willed—silently—inwardly—to myself? What do you say to that? Can you explain that Dr. Herdal?","Yes on what day did you hang the wreath on the tower? Well? Tell me at once!","Have you several nurseries?","Good night. Sleep well—if you can.","Oh indeed.","Well and why not?","Took the wreath with him! Oh God! oh God! Brovik—you must go down to him! Get him to come back here!","Are all these your drawings yours?","Well or to have a little joke with you. Upon my soul I don't recollect. But it must have been something of that kind for you were a mere child then.","Then I suppose he is very clever.","Oh so far as that goes—there are plenty of people here that have learnt from me and have come to little enough for all that.","Do you think you can see that in the drawings?","Ragnar and Uncle say I must. So I suppose I shall have to give in.","And you have not told your wife the rights of the story?","Yes I hear people talk of that but it is utterly impossible—","Oh there are devils innumerable abroad in the world Hilda that one never sees.","No indeed Mr. Solness! What can be the good of that? No one but you should be allowed to build. You should stand quite alone—do it all yourself. Now you know it.","Oh by all means.","And so you think it time there were an end of it. Is not that so?","But what made you speak of these vikings Mr. Solness?","His will is to reach the top—so at the top you shall see him.","You will not see that—not this time.","Did you see that?","Quite so! The others came in. To think of my forgetting that too!","Yes indeed I did. How free and great he looked as he stood and fastened the wreath to the church vane!","Oh heavens—easier for me—!","I just happened to recollect her.","Is it a woman?","Not those cosy happy homes for mother and father and for the troop of children?","So we have found a use for one our nurseries after all Aline.","Yes it is. But Ragnar was absolutely bent on setting to work for himself. He would hear of nothing else.","Have you never noticed Hilda how the impossible—how it seems to beckon and cry aloud to one?","Yes but at the time I did not breathe a word of what was in my mind. I merely stood and looked at her—and kept on wishing intently that I could have her here. Then I talked to her a little in a friendly way—about one thing and another. And then she went away.","For building up the souls of little children Hilda. For building up children's souls in perfect balance and in noble and beautiful forms. For enabling them to soar up into erect and full-grown human souls. That was Aline's talent. And there it all lies now—unused and unusable for ever—of no earthly service to any one—just like the ruins left by a fire.","I wonder whether there will be any use for such homes in the coming time.","Oh it all seems to me so foolish—so foolish!","Impossible—impossible yes! But there I stood all the same!","Him! Oh yes I daresay!","He has kept us down so long—now we are going to see him keep quietly down below himself.","And yet you build all these nurseries.","One you employ here in your office?","Yes I do.","He get dizzy! No I know quite well he does not!","The fact is you do far too much for my sake.","Oh yes no doubt he has learnt something from me too.","We shall see it!","He! Oh yes I am likely to believe that!","That you—? Say it at once!","I don't think there was any sort of threat in that.","But you don't now? Not in the least?","I think that must have been thrilling.","What day—?","Live—of your own free will—with a ruffian like that?","Ah that is the great the terrible question. That is the doubt that is gnawing me—night and day.","My dear Aline ought you not to go out for a little walk?","Can we not give her one of the nurseries? They are all ready as it is.","Till she can get her things a little in order you know.","In the sagas—. Have you read any of the old sagas?","No I can't for the life of me understand how you can be so stupid.","By all means.","I am afraid you will have to go in my dear lady—","Oh yes—I'm sure he is frightfully clever.","Then be it so.","Then I hope with all my heart that the devils will choose carefully for you Hilda.","It was you—you that he let go! What do you suppose he cares about strange women like her?","Yes it is Halvard! Oh my great God—! Halvard! Halvard!","Hush! Don't shout to him!","I wonder if he isn't going to die now as well?","But good Lord what would you have had her say then?","For me they have chosen already—once and for all.","Oh Mr. Solness—! My lovely lovely castle. Our castle in the air!","The princess shall have her castle.","You ought to go home father. Try to get a little sleep—","Yes it does. And if she is so good—as you say she is—why should she talk in that way?","All of it the whole thing. And yet perhaps—I may not have had anything to do with it.","Oh indeed!","Well you see I got it out of you at last!","You may build as much as ever you like Halvard—you can never build up again a real home for me!","I wonder whether one really has not the right! And yet and yet—. Oh! if one could only sleep the whole thing away!","Is it possible that all this time he has been afraid of me?","I mean—don't let him throw up his good situation with me. For then I can keep you too my dear Kaia.","Oh yes how lovely that would be if it could only be managed!","This happiness—h'm—this happiness was not to be bought any cheaper Hilda.","Do I? And why should I do that? Put the thought away from me?","But how can you get on without her—? Oh well no doubt you have some one else in reserve Halvard.","Was not that what you wished?","I like listening to strange stories.","The bird of prey loves to range—","Very well then. I daresay you recollect that I took Knut Brovik and his son into my employment—after the old man's business had gone to the dogs.","Yes but in a very different way from what I meant.","Well well—as you please.","And bent my head back?","Oh. I beg pardon Mr. Solness——","One whom you have no right to set aside.","Do you read them all too?","Go to bed I suppose? Would you have me stifled outright?","No. What thought should that be?","Perhaps you have noticed it already?","Never? Then why did you leave him?","Don't tell me you can ever be dizzy!","H'm! May I ask then what sort of a conscience one ought to have?","Well it will be all right I daresay. In the meantime you must excuse my leaving you here with my husband until I can get a room made a little more comfortable for you.","What am I to do here now?","Yes and that always helps to relieve one's mind a little. One can breathe more freely for a while you understand.","But something else just as good?","That I should come back to your home and take you away with me?","Oh yes surely you can understand. Just think if he were really to do it! If he should take it into his head to climb up the scaffolding!","Had you a long talk I asked?","Oh no! Oh no! I shall stay out here and wait for Halvard.","May I have a glass of water?","That I have! And why in all the world should I do that?","What! Don't you take a run down into the garden every day then?","Yes I suppose I am a strange sort of bird.","But on her side?","But it's what came of the fire—the dreadful thing that followed—! That is the thing! That that that!","I must be down below with the men.","Halvard!","You will have other things to think of now and to attend to and that is a very good thing for you. Well go home with the drawings now Miss Fosli. At once! Do you hear?","Yes yes that's all right. Hasn't Ragnar come too?","But I cannot do anything else. For if she runs away from me—then Ragnar will be off too.","So that is it is it? Halvard Solness is to see about retiring now! To make room for younger men! For the very youngest perhaps! He must make room! Room! Room!","When I went in to see her she was busy putting her things in order.","What have you to do down there Halvard?","Oho! Perhaps you could do the same yourself?","Then don't look up at him.","Did I really?","Oh you haven't really forgotten anything: you are only a little ashamed of it all. I am sure one doesn't forget things of that kind.","You understand nothing—since you can talk like that! No I will tell you why he kept hold of her.","Oh I shall die of terror. I cannot bear to see it.","Yes but even if this were so—?","But he has stayed with you all the same.","Not mine either?","You came and put your arms round me?","The castle.","Well then why?","Oh are you there my dear—?","If only one had the viking-spirit in life—","For there must surely be plenty of other thing to be done here.","No no you really mustn't say that Aline! I cannot bear to hear you say such things!","What would you call it then?","Yes but I never proposed you should.","Are you searching for anything?","Now I can see that you are thinking of—of her.","Come now I like you for that.","But I won't allow you to!","Come here and I will show you something.","Yes—just think of my forgetting such a thing as that.","It was simply and solely by that fire that I was enabled to build homes for human beings. Cosy comfortable bright homes where father and mother and the whole troop of children can live in safety and gladness feeling what a happy thing it is to be alive in the world—and most of all to belong to each other—in great things and in small.","No. We have no child. But now you can be the child here for the time being.","Yes I should say you must be. If you could only cease thing about the two little children—","So it was to see Ragnar that they came here—whilst I was out!","No no it is not—not as it was in my mother's and father's time. They have taken away so much—so much of the garden Miss Wangel. Fancy—they have parcelled it out—and built houses for strangers—people that I don't know. And they can sit and look in upon me from their windows.","He took the wreath with him.","I used to try to. Do you read much?","Yes indeed! I did expect that of you.","Do you think he will?","Yes at least as good.","No goodness knows I don't understand at all—","Yes that seems to me perfectly natural.","Nearer!","Yes—I have.","Devils too?","Oh yes that can be managed. Now I'll just let my wife know—","I think I shall never go home again.","Miss Fosli must stay—just for a moment. There is a letter I want written.","You are the very being I have needed most.","That he might keep her with him.","You must go on believing in me!","Kaia!","Give them to the old man as soon as you can.","Ah—you think she will?","Really? Has it not?","Is your father alive still?","Are you cold Hilda? I think you look cold.","No other than her own suspicious nature.","Yes thanks to the fire. I laid out almost the whole of the garden in villa lots and there I was able to build after my own heart. So I came to the front with a rush.","Yes there is one he is striving with.","The kingdom on the table!","Oho!","Then they would let Ragnar build their home for them?","Yes but if it is all the work of these helpers and servers—?","Do you want a castle now?","Yes but you have to write your approval on them.","Oh yes do!","Yes they usually go together.","You came and kissed me Mr. Solness.","And there never will be one.","The house you are soon going to move into?","I would not believe it either until to-day—when she said so herself.","Perhaps I will. Presently presently dear. In a little while.","Yes so I see.","You surely cannot mean to deny it?","Well not exactly anxious. He really came to see me but he would like to say how-do-you-do to you at the same time.","And which in my heart I yearn towards so deeply.","It seems to have a very high tower.","What brings you up here just now?","Well well my dear doctor—don't let us discuss this any further. We had better agree to differ.","No.","I won't have any thanks! Tell him that from me.","But as I said before that fire was the making of me—as a builder I mean.","In case you thought that Ragnar's drawings—","Yes to be sure! For the ten years are up now and I am not going to wait any longer. So—out with the castle Mr. Solness!","But I suppose you will be staying for some time?","Oh we can talk about that some other time. For the present let us keep to this business of the fire.","And don't you know any one here?","Women you see—in certain matters they have a deucedly keen intuition—","That will give you plenty of exercise.","At last! At last! Now I see him great and free again!","Yes it is the impossible that he is doing now!","Oh no! I daresay I shall find something else to talk to Mr. Solness about.","The nursery?","Yes God knows that is my duty. But when one has duties in so many directions—","And God knows whether you are not right in saying that it will be no better for us in the new house either.","What do you mean by that Aline?","I will have you do it! I will have it!","I will say to him: Hear me Mighty Lord—thou may'st judge me as seems best to thee. But hereafter I will build nothing but the loveliest thing in the world—","Your own garden!","But you have been——","Yes Miss Wangel's name is Hilda. I knew her when she was a child.","Father is fast growing weaker—and therefore I beg and implore you to write a few kind words for me on one of the plans! Something for father to read before he—","Stop! Stop! For God's sake—!","Yes?","Oh very well deuce take it all—then I did do it I suppose.","Oh you don't much care about doing it.","I wonder whether you were not sent into the world with a sickly conscience.","Is it long since you found out that I was married?","And try to occupy his attention as long as possible—","Her name is Miss Fosli.","But if only you could get to know her thoroughly—! Ah she is so good—so kind—so excellent a creature—","You do not really know him yet Miss Wangel.","Have you a very bad memory?","What sort of castle have you imagined Hilda?","You must have been a mere child then I should think.","I will have it settled I say! And to-morrow too—not a day later!","Then good heavens—if that is so—can't you tell the least little bit of a lie for once in a way?","Yes of course you ought!","Oh yes I don't deny it.","I almost think I must have.","Yes yes now I must go.","Don't stand there like a statue. You must have dreamt all this.","But I advise you to take care Miss Wangel! For you don't know him rightly yet.","And found some flowers too I see.","What have you come for?","Did you notice it yourself?","They say they positively must see the ceremony.","That was a very ugly thing to do.","Then I am to pass out of life without any certainty? Without a gleam of happiness? Without any faith or trust in Ragnar? Without having seen a single piece of work of his doing? Is that to be the way of it?","I hear a song—a mighty song!","What—you and Miss Wangel here still?","Here I am—?","You are ill Mr. Solness. Very ill I almost think.","Yes of course it was then we met.","I didn't like it. I know how free and happy I felt when that tower was finished.","Why it was nothing much to talk about it seems to me.","Homes for human beings Hilda.","Now I see you again as I did when there was song in the air!","I will not go till he comes! I and determined to have it out this evening with—","Yes tell him that! Tell him that!","Ha—ha—! I haven't much time for waiting.","I do you say? I do that?","Oh it has been the greatest fun. For Mr. Solness—he has such a miraculous memory. All the least little details he remembers instantly.","I knew she would go at once if I came.","No indeed I assure you—","Who do you say it is?","Why my dear fellow—!","Not to be always seeing how heavily the loss of the little boys weighs upon her?","And what does she think about you?","Can you not talk to—her too?","Yes of course it is.","If the builder will.","Over the new house which will never be a home for me.","No matter—. I say you ought not to be like that.","There was music in the churchyard—and many many hundreds of people. We school-girls were dressed in white and we all carried flags.","Yes I did.","Yes but that is just what makes me so horribly afraid.","Oh I was thinking of something quite different.","No no that is quite impossible. If Ragnar leaves me and starts work on his own account then of course he will need you himself.","You don't mean that you yourself—?","No I can't bear it much longer!","And then you said that when I grew up I should be your princess.","But can you never get over that?","But deuce take it—how about Ragnar then! It's Ragnar that I—","No but it is so. It must be so!","Pooh! Is that all? That only amuses me.","Why don't you do it then?","And of course he has the wreath to carry too. Oh I do hope he will be careful!","Yes they have a bad habit of wanting to marry.","You may well say that Hilda.","And you are determined not to go back to it?","What do you say to that Miss Hilda?","Can't you get hold of some one else who will do just as well?","You are right there. Everything favoured you. But then how can you have the heart to let me go to my grave—without having seen what Ragnar is fit for? And of course I am anxious to see them married too—before I go.","No there isn't is there? But then what is it that troubles you so?","—Aline's intuition as you call it—in a certain sense it has not been so far astray.","Very high?","I tell you the younger generation will one day come and thunder at my door! They will break in upon me!","Run down for the doctor—","I am afraid of retribution Hilda.","That too!","Not well. He begs you to excuse him he is obliged to keep his bed to-day.","It will be fearfully thrilling.","Yes. It's the band of the Mason's Union.","Good heavens you know very well one can't choose whom one is going to love.","Yes yes. But is there anything going on here? I got a note from you.","And yet you would bar him out. Fie Mr. Solness!","Why not?","Drawn you out? Again I have not the faintest notion of what you mean Mr. Solness.","Do you mean that you did not do it?","Yes no doubt they are stupid. But now tell me what it is—the loveliest thing in the world—that we two are to build together?","Do you think I am so very far wrong then?","Mr. Solness—you mean our castles in the air.","It has not been put very severely to the test I should think.","Now you are standing there again like a statue just as you stood last night.","Yes yes—we know all that! And so they are content to take whatever is offered them. They get a—a roof over their heads—an address—but nothing to call a home. No thank you! In that case let them apply to somebody else. Tell them that the next time they call.","Aline!","Can you not? To me it seems all so simple.","They did not get over that?","Well I admit—one couldn't well avoid noticing that your wife—h'm—","What is the matter father?","Oh I don't know what to think about him now. The doctor has been telling me all sorts of things and putting it all together with several things I have heard him say—","Oh that I will you may be very certain!","SOLNESS. —and waved and flourished with her flag so that I—so that it almost made me giddy to look at it.","So much the better!","Why then you must go home to him! You must attend to your father!","What happened? Do tell me! Was any one burnt?","Yes yes you are right in that! Poor Mr. Solness—you fancy that—","Well that was an appetising name.","Oh if we only could!","Well now are you not happy—in other respects?","But sooner or later he too must have a chance of doing something on his own account.","Yes if you'll only talk sensibly—","Oh yes the boys. But you see that was a thing apart. That was a dispensation of Providence and in such things one can only bow in submission—yes and be thankful too.","Miss Wangel!","No. I build no more church-towers now. Nor churches either.","She! For building?","Kaia—Kaia!","Well that was better fun than to sit there knitting stockings with all those old women.","Who will not allow her?","I know what you are going to build next!","Indeed?","She? That poor little creature?","And yet—perhaps in one single thing.","Have you—?","He climbs and climbs. Higher and higher! Higher and higher! Look! Just look!","Hilda—!","Stay where you are Hilda!—I ought to tell a lie you say. Oh yes for the sake of his old father I might well do that—for in my time I have crushed him trodden him under foot—","Could you not engage a clerk?","But do beg the man to be careful when he goes up! Promise me that Halvard!","No no. There is rather something of the bird of prey in you.","I don't in the least understand what you mean.","Yes people say that you are afraid to climb about—on the scaffoldings you know.","Oh yes I suppose there are trolls of that kind in the world too.","Then just go and find them for me. I might perhaps glance over them after all.","Yes for I had duties on both sides—both towards you and towards the little ones. I ought to have hardened myself—not to have let the horror take such hold upon me—nor the grief for the burning of my home.","I believe there is scarcely a corner in me that is safe from you.","That's what you promised.","Good. I will do so Mrs. Solness.","Yes I must say it seems to me you have had the luck on your side to an astounding degree.","Yes precisely.","Odd that she should never have mentioned it.","No of course not.","Chiefly to you.","Ah—here one can sit and sun oneself like a cat.","Hush—they can hear you!","Oh tell him—tell him what you will for me. Best to say nothing at all to him!","Don't waste time talking. The poor old man might go and die in the meantime.","This is terrible. So after all he could not do it.","Oho! Was it about her that Aline was talking to you?","It was this impulse within me that urged and goaded me to come—and lured and drew me on as well.","The wreath! Oh that will be glorious!","Why have you never written to me? Then I could have answered you.","The letter—?","Yes indeed you sang then. It sounded like harps in the air.","Nothing.","Yes don't you understand? He wanted to give me the chance of becoming an accomplished master in my own sphere—so that I might build all the more glorious churches for him. At first I did not understand what he was driving at but all of a sudden it flashed upon me.","Pooh! I won't have anything to do with that stupid kingdom. I have set my heart upon quite a different one!","It was when I was building the church-tower up at Lysanger.","Thanks—may I?","Yes for no one else knew about it.","Good morning Mr. Solness!","Quite deliciously! Like a child in a cradle. Oh—I lay and stretched myself like—like a princess!","That depends on how you look at it. As a builder the fire was the making of me—","The whole of it?","With what?","No not at such a time as that. But—\"Princess Hilda\"—that will sound very well I think.","Well you see it's about Ragnar. That is what weighs most upon me. What is to become of him?","Oh yes I thought about it—but never got any further. Every time I intended to set to work it seemed just as if a hand held me back. Not to-day I thought—to-morrow and nothing ever came of it.","No no I think that is only natural.","Because I had not fortitude enough in misfortune.","You see that was really the reason why he made the old house burn down.","Good evening—","No—I must admit that—just for the moment—","We met at one of the mountain stations this summer.","As I say only little things. All the old portraits were burnt on the walls. And all the old silk dresses were burnt what had belonged to the family for generations and generations. And all mother's and grandmother's lace—that was burnt too. And only think—the jewels too!","Oh no no Miss Wangel—do not talk to me any more about the two little boys. We ought to feel nothing but joy in thinking of them for they are so happy—so happy now. No it is the small losses in life that cut one to the heart—the loss of all that other people look upon as almost nothing.","Oh is it you that—","Was he not cheered by what I wrote?","Was there a tower on that house too?","It was just after the birth of the two little boys—","Because I was revolving something in my mind.","Yes I surely don't need to remind you of that?","But that is just what he does not like. He feels that he cannot stay here any longer.","No not to begin with.","I had noticed the split in the flue long long before the fire. Every time I went up into the attic I looked to see if it was still there.","It will soon be all over with me. My strength is ebbing—from day to day.","I don't want the poor children to know how I am.","Then did you pull down the ramshackle old place?","I promised the foreman I would.","A real castle in the air?","They came healthy and bonny into the world. And they were growing too—you could see the difference day to day.","But then—it was after that—that the real thing happened.","Don't you remember that a great dinner was given in your honour at the Club?","Too late!","Yes I should think you did.","No indeed! Oh no! I knew that instinctively. For if you had been you could never have stood up there and sung.","That little devil—that was I.","Oh it was so gloriously thrilling! I could not have believed there was a builder in the whole world that could build such a tremendously high tower. And then that you yourself should stand at the very top of it as large as life! And that you should not be the least bit dizzy! It was that above everything that made one—made one dizzy to think of.","It is the loveliest thing in the world you say.","—especially for the builders who have a—a dizzy conscience.","Why Hilda of course.","Castles in the air?","It's tremendously thrilling—when you fall and fall—","But there is nothing behind it! I have never done you any wrong—not wittingly and willfully at any rate. And yet—and yet it seems as though a crushing debt rested upon me and weighed me down.","Well and what if they do?","The worst of all.","It sounds such a ludicrous little thing for you see the whole story turns upon nothing but a crack in the chimney.","And then?","For your sake Kaia dear. Now let me have them at once please.","Oh but uncle—","Is it a good thing!","Should you like to hear about it?","Out there on the rising ground—where you see the new house—","After you were grown up?","Well but he has learnt nothing—nothing thoroughly I mean. Except of course to draw.","Then you are so?","And they were burnt too?","No no! It is not that.","Devils—","No I believe they didn't.","For of course it was to be bitterly cold that day?","He? What he?","Oh nonsense! What should make the luck turn?","But then you said \"little Hilda\" and I didn't like that.","Come in.","You should have tied a knot in your pocket-handkerchief Mr. Solness.","I suppose I must be—or not far from it.","So do I.","For you see Hilda—up there amidst those new surroundings I used to go about musing and pondering within myself. Then I saw plainly why he had taken my little children from me. It was that I should have nothing else to attach myself to. No such thing as love and happiness you understand. I was to be only a master builder—nothing else and all my life long I was to go on building for him.","Poor Mrs. Solness. First of all there was the fire—","Yes I did. But that was horrid.","DR. HERDAL. —that your wife is not particularly fond of this Miss Fosli.","Yes you may depend upon it he has the ability! He is the younger generation that stands ready to knock at my door—to make an end of Halvard Solness.","And when I stood there high over everything and was hanging the wreath over the vane I said to him: Hear me now thou Mighty One! From this day forward I will be a free builder—I too in my sphere—just as thou in thine. I will never more build churches for thee—only homes for human beings.","It is indeed. And that is why I have locked and barred myself in.","Tell me—did you notice anything odd about Aline?","Oh stop a moment! Are Ragnar's drawings in there?","Come out with your pencil now. You must have a pencil about you?","Tell me one thing Hilda.","It is hopeless Hilda. The luck is bound to turn. A little sooner or a little later. Retribution is inexorable.","It must have been very short.","I was afraid the whole thing might fall to pieces.—But we were going to write on the drawings Mr. Solness.","I want my kingdom.","And please please think kindly of me.","Well then come in here.","Halvard—for God's sake—","Why this that I often feel ready to sink under this terrible burden of debt—","My—my Master Builder!","A little bit—for a week or so. Good heavens Mr. Solness you surely know how such things come about.","The head is all crushed.—he fell right into the quarry.","For any one else I suppose you mean?","No not at all.","But now I am building a new home for myself—just opposite here.","Oh not at all. It's only my duty so I am very glad to do it.","But you—yourself—you rose upon the ruins. You began as a poor boy from a country village—and now you are at the head of your profession. Ah yes Mr. Solness you have undoubtedly had the luck on your side.","Well but now listen Mr. Solness. Are you perfectly certain that the fire was caused by that little crack in the chimney!","Yes do! At once!","See that is the upshot of the whole affair however far back I look. Nothing really built nor anything sacrificed for the chance of building. Nothing nothing! the whole is nothing!","Here are a few things I have got for you Miss Wangel. The large parcels will be sent later on.","And I must say I am scarcely surprised at it.","Can I be of any use to you Mr. Solness?","Wangel? Is your name Wangel?","You said yourself only just now that no one but I ought to be allowed to build.","It is chiefly on Ragnar's account that—that you—?","Do you say that now?","Yes. Let them come in to you on friendly terms as it were.","I know you do not require me any more but to-day I shall remain.","If Ragnar Brovik gets his chance he will strike me to the earth. Crush me—as I crushed his father.","When one has gone through so much trouble as you have—","Of course it is you I want to keep.—you above everything Kaia. But for that very reason you must prevent Ragnar too from throwing up his situation. There there—now go home.","Yes. It is almost finished. And on that there is a tower.","Yes it must have been a great grief to her.","Yes you did. And when I asked how long I should have to wait you said that you would come again in ten years—like a troll—and carry me off—to Spain or some such place. And you promised you would buy me a kingdom there.","We kept them only about three weeks. Or scarcely so much.","I needed room for myself. But this Ragnar—he must on no account be allowed to come to the front.","What!","I am not laughing in the least.","And I'll try to get one or two things that you may require.","Hang it man you can't expect me to drag commissions down from the moon for him!","Has he?","I know that well.","Yes twins. It's eleven or twelve years ago now.","You didn't call me a little devil then?","Yes of course—so they all are.","Yes. And you told me too what the kingdom was to be called.","Kaia?","I won't have anything to do with these strangers. They may apply to whom they please so far as I am concerned.","No no. I beg you pardon—","After you were married too?","Hilda—tell me what that is!","The fright had shaken Aline terribly. The alarm—the escape—the break-neck hurry—and then the ice-cold night air—for they had to be carried out just as they lay—both she and the little ones.","When the tower was finished we had grand doings in the town.","That was mainly what I meant—at all events yesterday. For to-day I am not so sure—","Quite alone Miss Wangel?","How can you sit there and say such things?","And no doubt it is to have a high tower!","How can you like to stand at such a dizzy height—?","I most of all surely who have paid so dear for my position.","Mr. Solness I will stand here and look on at you.","Well that is a long time ago.","Very well then perhaps we better go in.","Trifles! I like that! Perhaps it was a trifle too that I was alone in the room when you came in?","But surely you ought to be with him.","Oh those two! They must wait. I am not quite clear about the plans yet.","But he will never be able to build any more. Poor builder!","The people are safe enough. Ragnar knows them. He is a friend of the family.","Then you climbed right up the scaffolding straight to the very top and you had a great wreath with you and you hung that wreath right away up on the weather-vane.","Did you not like building the church-tower in our town?","It was so wonderfully thrilling to stand below and look up at you. Fancy if he should fall over! He—the master builder himself!","Oh no they stood it well enough. But Aline fell into a fever and it affected her milk. She would insist on nursing them herself because it was her duty she said. And both our little boys they—","Yes I suppose I must.","Oh that such things should be allowed to happen here the world!","With the greatest of pleasure.","Not if I can mount hand in hand with you Hilda.","And what is that?","Good. Put them down there on the table.","What do I mean?","Well well well—don't bite me.—You talk of trolls—but I think you go on like a troll yourself.","Oh if it only depended on me—","Oh no let me have the pleasure of doing that!","No one else?","Yes for I dreamed I was falling over a frightfully high sheer precipice. Do you never have that kind of dream?","I must tell you—I have begun to be afraid of the younger generation.","I had never before been able to climb up to a great free height. But that day I did it.","If that is so we shall see one of these days whether I am one of the chosen.","Here you see one at all events.","Don't you remember that? You called me Hilda yourself—that day when you misbehaved.","What do you mean by that?","Oh never mind what I say.—Would they give Ragnar the building of that villa?","And then came what was worse.","No not of that.","Pooh! The younger generation! You are not laid on the shelf yet I should hope. Oh no—your position here is probably firmer now than it has ever been.","—and pushing your way up and taking the wind out of my sails—mine and so may other people's.","Oh they went westward.","The dolls?","Oh indeed! But are you certain then that—that he was not—pleased with you?","I suppose she is very chilly by nature?","That—?","Yes that must be difficult indeed.","No thank you. And besides he is not in. He is over there with his workmen. But he looked so fierce that I did not dare to talk to him.","What then?","Hurrah for Master Builder Solness!","I owe a boundless debt to you—to you—to you Aline.","Oh how kind you are to me!","How is it? Is he alive?","Sick? Are you ill Halvard?","Oh yes now and then. When I was perfectly furious with you for not coming.","I cannot do anything else Ragnar!","Oh but this is hopeless hopeless! Never a ray of sunlight! Not so much as a gleam of brightness to light up our home!","When you and Miss Wangel are alone I daresay she will tell you Halvard.","No never! Nor your wife's mind either I am convinced. I could almost swear to that.","Not that that was necessary.","Don't you owe me a kingdom I should like to know?","Well—you admit you owe me this kingdom. And you can't have a kingdom without a royal castle I should think.","Now don't be offended—but hasn't she?","I will go straight home with them.","Now seriously speaking—what have you come for? What do you really want to do here?","Out with my kingdom Mr. Solness!","So you see Hilda—it is my fault after all that the lives of the two little boys had to be sacrificed. And do you think it is not my fault too that Aline has never been the woman she should and might have been—and that she most longed to be?","Oh is it you Hilda? I was afraid it might be Aline or the Doctor.","Don't you think that fire would have happened all the same—even without your wishing for it?","Oh yes certainly. For you have known her so well in the past. Ever since she was a child—you tell me.","My castle of course.","The girl at the desk.","Oh no one knows him as I do!","Put those things away! I have seen enough of them.","Write my approval on them? Never!","That he might—? Tell me at once!","Miss Wangel—!",". H'm—is the doctor so very anxious to see me?","What do you want with me Aline?","Yes to be sure it's about him. Do come in.","And they are good for nothing? And I am good for nothing too?","Do you think so?","For I have no other clothes than those I stand in except a change of linen in my knapsack. And that has to go to the wash for it's very dirty.","Did you think you noticed anything of the kind?","Neither one nor the other. But never mind—it doesn't matter now.","How can you say such a thing?","I want my kingdom. The time is up.","Oh well it just occurred to me.","Good! Then build it for me! This moment!","The two little children—they are not so easy to forget Hilda.","Mr. Solness!","Poor poor little Kaia—","But then you must have seen her too?","Well well then I must go home and tell father what you say—I promised I would.—Is this what I am to tell father—before he dies?","There there there! There he comes doctor. Let me have a word with you.","Ah up there?","Well now I must ask you to let me stay the night here.","Hush! I hear him on the stairs.","Nothing but houses for people to live in.","But homes with high towers and pinnacles upon them.","Yes take them—take them by all means! They are lying there on the table.","Is it very painful for you that she should avoid you in this way?","Then you don't like to look ugly Kaia?","Oh it comes to the same thing.","Yes I am.","He!","Yes better wait father!","Don't care! Who dares to say that?","Yes do dear Miss Wangel. Keep as firm hold of him as ever you can.","Do you see over here in the garden—?","Up at Lysanger?","Now listen to me my dear Mr. Solness. May I ask you a question quite between ourselves?","A happy man you said—","Nobody must move! Do you dear?","Yes—in full uniform! But to-day I am not going climbing and breaking my neck. We two will stop quietly below and look on doctor.","Don't you think so too?","It was to be called the kingdom of Orangia* you said.","As for the old house I wouldn't mind so much about that. When once misfortune was in the air—why—","For you must know I have run through all my money.","A lie?","No I should hope not—considering what you did next—","I don't think you have any right to ask that question doctor.","Hilda—do you know what you are?","Then you admit it now?","Was that what you were thinking of?","Not in the least. Miss Fosli has only a short letter to write.","Now just listen—","Two little boys. They were of the same age.","Yes but people might take it into their heads that you were mad too you see.","I don't feel that it is mine any longer.","Retire? I?","What are these helpers and servers?","But look here now doctor—h'm—","Has he told you so?","What sort of work do you mean?","Yes I will—","I should like your conscience to be—to be thoroughly robust.","If there's nothing else for it I am quite willing to break off the engagement.","She was standing at the desk as she always is—when I go through the room.","The one that is being built yes. Almost finished.","Oh not just on that account surely?","Well what then?","I feel as if I were looking at something utterly impossible.","Oh Hilda—it is not every day that I can do that.","What will you say to him?","No—I don't know that I have anything particular to say to him.","On the contrary I am just going to begin!","Oh no you may well say that.","The castles in the air—yes.","How is the old man to-day?","No you must answer that question for yourself.","Only my simple duty. Nothing more than that.","I can't stir a root—","He is falling! He is falling!","Yes the middle one. But first let us go in to supper.","I suppose you think you have drawn me out nicely now doctor?","That you have been quietly keeping an eye upon me.","Oh it was no such simple matter to leave father—I am so awfully fond of him.","I don't \"run\" anywhere nowadays.","Did you really Halvard? Well shall we go?",". Oh is it you Miss Wangel?","Then I think the builder will come.","Oh you don't understand my position.","Is that how you would like to have it?","Then you must be a daughter of the district doctor up at Lysanger?","Your fault! The fire!","That?","I will take it down to them myself","Oh yes Halvard I understand you very well. You are so anxious to spare me—and to find excuses for me too—as much as ever you can.","To tell you the truth I think people would stare at you a little.","No the people will not have it.","But could I not stay with you even if Ragnar—?","Afraid? Because you have the luck on your side!","I will—I will have it so!","Aha! there we have it!","I had only a cage.","Yes yes.","The wild bird never wants to go back to the cage.","It will be splendid to see you so high up once more.","Oh why why could it not have happened so!","Only the smoke?","Oh you know very well there is only one person I care for now! I shall never care for any one else.","For Heaven's sake Miss Wangel don't imagine such a thing! My husband!—when he always gets so dizzy!","Well well I suppose I must go to them after all. It is my duty.","Far from it. I don't hide myself away under the bushes.","Strange that you should say that—for that is just what I am most anxious to do.","What a lot of books you have.","Oh then I suppose we met up there that summer when I was building a tower on the old church.","Yes I do.—For once in a way.","Go home Ragnar—both to him and to her. Give me the wreath.","Here with us? Oh yes certainly.","—with him—with the chief.","Is the builder to be allowed to come up beside the princess?","No not that. Every one got safe and sound out of the house—","Do you think so too?","No that would never do. Now that they are here it is my duty to see them. But do you stay out here in the meantime—and receive him when he comes.","And give you a kingdom as well?","I know that too.","\"Hurrah for Master Builder Solness!\" Yes!","Has any one been here for me?","Not to have her before your eyes?","And make a princess of you?","Yes indeed! Is that how you feel too?","Then I will tell you all about it.","And from the Club you were invited to come round to our house to supper.","Hush hush—for God's sake! He is coming! Try to get that idea out of his head. And let us be friends Miss Wangel. Don't you think we can?","No I think I shall let that alone!","It was the prettiest sight in the world to see Aline lying with the two of them in her arms.—But then came the night of the fire—","Had you put by all these dolls then? Ever since you were little?","No I didn't like it a bit for it seemed as though you wanted to make game of me.","Is it you that writes in this great ledger?","Right above the great quarry—?","I cannot do any harm to one whom I know! I can't take away anything that belongs to her.","Certainly.","When I told you all this about the fire—h'm—","Are you pleased at the thought of moving over to the new house?","How was it now? What came of all this—between us two.","A bad memory? No not that I am aware of.","Well that is quite a special thing.","That! Why I am going to build that myself.","Well then next day pretty late in the evening when old Brovik and Ragnar had gone home she came here again and behaved as if I had made an arrangement with her.","That is nearer it—perhaps.","Do you think that Ragnar has quite talent enough to stand alone?","So we were. And for that matter—","You lost the two little boys.","I must have thought all that. I must have wished it—have willed it—have longed to do it. And then—. May not that be the explanation.","Yes that is just what he would get. He has made sure of that—has my fine gentleman!","We have had children—Aline and I.","I think nothing at all about the new house.","That—? Well?","Just once more Mr. Solness! Do the impossible once again!","Look! There goes the foreman up the ladders.","Yes who else should it be but myself?","Mind now kindly and cordially! Oh how I hate—how I hate this Ruald—","Why of course by all means let him rest. But now get to your work.","Yes in her manner to me. Did you notice anything?","It will never be any better. Just as empty—just as desolate—there as here.","Did you notice whether the—the book-keeper was out there?","That seems to me better than to have them all standing empty.","Go go now!","I believe there is only one possible dwelling-place for human happiness—and that is what I am going to build now.","Then I should say you ought to go out and open the door to the younger generation.","Oh may he come and thank you for all—?","Yes if necessary. For I must—I must stay here with you! I can't leave you! That is utterly—utterly impossible!","What did you do then?","Are we to have music too?","I should think so.","H'm—that's not very hard to explain.","The fight I have been fighting has cost heart's blood enough.—And I am afraid too that the helpers and servers will not obey me any longer.","But this is im—","They have indeed. There is not the least doubt of that. But—?","It has all become so strange to me. I am almost afraid to see it again.","I will se it! I will and I must see it!","I! Retire in favour of your son!","How in the world did that come into your head?","I scarcely know myself.","Yes I think it is. I have never noticed that it wasn't.","Come now I really must say—","In reality there is nothing whatever the matter with me.","I believe now that most people are just as puny creatures as I am in that respect.","Oh come out with it I have seen it quite clearly you know.","He must be dashed to pieces—killed on the spot.","Hilda?","Ragnar—you must come and take your father home.","Miss Wangel—do you see all those young fellows down in the street?","Is he not here? Where has he gone to?","Come here! At once!","In the sagas you read about vikings who sailed to foreign lands and plundered and burned and killed men—","Mr. Solness is down with the men.","That my master builder dares not—cannot—climb as high as he builds?","Yes these devils! And the troll within me as well—they have drawn all the life-blood out of her.","Don't you think she did it in order to be with her sweetheart?","Oh no! But all the same—. It's so delicious to lie and dream.","Oh yes! Almost always.","Yes you must be very tired I should think.","Oh you know you're ill Halvard. This proves it! Oh God—Oh God!","But how can I help turning into a troll when this is how it always goes with me in everything—in everything!","Is that the way you look at it?","What do you dream about most?","What is so terrible?","Yes was it not? And now she wanted to know what she was to do here—whether she could begin the very next morning and so forth.","I mean of course—when once we have moved into the new home.","After this?","You will find that we shall get on far better after this Aline. Things will be more comfortable. Life will be easier—especially for you.","Oh what a relief! Twice workmen have fallen and each time they were killed on the spot.","They are my fellow students come to look at the master.","How do you mean?","Oh is it not terrible even to think of—?","Ah do you think so Halvard? Will it be better then?","Oh that is what those boys want is it?","Yes mainly of Aline. For Aline—she too had her vocation in life just as much as I had mine.","Is there any letter?","Don't you see that I was right? He has given up all thought of that folly.","Oh Mr. Solness you know quite well what the end of it would be. And that is why I am going away.","No I am merely looking at all these things.","I don't believe I shall build much more.","That neither you nor I will see.","Yes entirely. If I happen to look at her when her back is turned I can tell that she feels it. She quivers and trembles the moment I come near her. What do you think of that?","Perhaps you have even forgotten what day it was?","That's a lot. Then I suppose you have a great many children?","Up there then. Right up there—","I felt sure you would not and so I have never cared to talk about it till now.—But it's a cursed nuisance to me in the long run you understand. Here have I got to go on day after day pretending—. And it's a shame to treat her so too poor girl.","Good devils and bad devils light-haired devils and black-haired devils. If only you could always tell whether it is the light or dark ones that have got hold of you!","Ragnar and I have been engaged for four or five years and so—","I shouldn't wonder.","What do you want with me?","But wait a moment—! Yes—it's the 19th of September today.","Well then a little bit of fun.","And carried off women—","Yes!","Oh yes do!—No no—don't say that I want anything! You can say that somebody is here and that he must come at once.","Some one you have taught?","Oh Miss Wangel you can't think how anxious I feel about him.","Very well. You had better put your things on too Kaia.","Stupid? Do you think I am so very stupid?","Oh he might be worse. For my purpose—","Oh perhaps I wasn't quite such a child either. Not such a mere chit as you imagine.","Oh yes. There we have room and to spare.","Is there anything in this to be terribly frightened about?","Well but what then?","That was not at all a bad idea.","Well!","That is just my feeling.","Yes down below—only down below.","Oh thank you. You know it wouldn't end there.","Miss Wangle was up long ago.","Are you quite certain that this is not a dream—a fancy that has fixed itself in your mind?","The why on earth don't you?","Good. I will go down to him myself.","Fie Mr. Solness! You said I should be a princess and that you would give me a kingdom. And then you went and—Well!","Why those fellows must have had robust consciences if you like! When they got home again they could eat and drink and be as happy as children. And the women too! They often would not leave them on any account. Can you understand that Hilda?","Why nothing more came of it. You know that quite well. For then the other guests came in and then—bah!","Then there must be—a little of the troll in you too.","That is where I always stand—on everyday occasions.","All what?","Yes we have.","Perhaps I mustn't?","But her vocation has had to be stunted and crushed and shattered—in order that mine might force its way to—to a sort of great victory. For you must know that Aline—she too had a talent for building.","Oh yes no doubt that's indispensable.","It's hard for me to hear you say that for you know it is mainly for your sake that I have built it.","But I stick to what I said. You'll see that things will be easier for you in the new place.","Yes I have got together a good many.","Shall I say you want to speak to him Mrs. Solness?","No that's not what I mean. But now I'll tell you something.","Why Aline—!","To your wife?","Is it you I have to thank for all this?","No you mustn't think that of me.","There are three nurseries in the house.","The foreman asked me to tell you that he is ready now to go up with the wreath.","You might have the topmost room in the tower Hilda—there you might live like a princess.","No I won't undertake to do that.","And what is to become of me when you are gone? What shall I have to live for then?—After that?","Who wants you to do that?","I am going away.","Simply to be here Hilda!","I almost think you are right Mr. Solness.","Have you forgotten again that the ten year are up?","Good night.","Ho-ho! Then it would be simple enough!","Give me your arm. Now let us go.","Aha! Perhaps you too think he is—well—?","Just like a troll—yes.","We are not in the habit of talking about it. For you always put the thought away from you—","Well well well—then we won't talk any more about it.","As well as who?","Oh I feel as if I could not be separated from you! It's quite quite impossible!","Dear me! for a month or two—","Over your new home yes.","Yes yes—depend upon it Halvard old Brovik is going to die too. You'll see that he will.","How have you become what you are Hilda?","As many as ever you like.","Then be sure you get those foolish notions out of Ragnar's head. Marry him as much as you please—","No indeed I haven't.","And all those blessed devils that you know so well—both the light-haired and the dark-haired ones.","How have you made me what I am?","Doctor Herdal—I am going to tell you a strange story—if you care to listen to it.","Why but it's—","He afraid! I would not be so conceited if I were you.","It is the master builder himself?","Hilda—you are like a wild bird of the woods.","No she is single.","Well in Heaven's name let us talk no more about it then.","But may it not come right even yet?","Yes I daresay! No thank you—nothing of that sort for me.","Yes so I have understood.","Well I for one am not the person to stand at a desk.","Never mind never mind—it will be all right Aline. Now all you have to do is think about moving into our new home—as quickly as you can. This evening we will hang up the wreath—","Rather range through the free air—","Perhaps you would stay here and—and write in the ledger?","Never in this world—never. That is another consequence of the fire—and of Aline's illness afterwards.","Oh you have kissed so many people in your time I suppose.","Well and is it not a great happiness for you to be able to build such beautiful homes?","In order to keep hold of you.","I keep on—incessantly—in silence and alone—brooding on that very thought.","Going away!","I will do the best I can for you. It's no more than my duty. I suppose your trunk is coming on later?","Yes do. I will come with you.","Oh he must have seen long ago that I had something in me too. Besides—cowardly—that is just what he is you see.","Well but in any case it is not your fault.","H'm—haven't thought much about it.","Aline! Will you come in here please. Here is a friend of yours—Miss Wangel.","Oh Mr. Solness—if you can talk like that I am afraid you must be—ill after all.","Good heavens that too! And just at this moment!","No not yet. He had to wait a little while to see the doctor. But he is coming presently to hear—","Oh there's not so very much room to spare either. But be that as it may—I will never retire! I will never give way to anybody! Never of my own free will. Never in this world will I do that!","No never! I have given it up. For it all seems so irrelevant.","I thought if you could build the highest church-towers in the world you could surely manage to raise a kingdom of one sort or another as well.","Don't you understand that I cannot help it? I am what I am and I cannot change my nature!","Yes indeed! There are such heaps of them in among the bushes.","Did you really and seriously expect me to come again?","Yes. Chiefly that.","Oh one can never tell what he might take into his head. I am afraid there is nothing he mightn't think of doing.","Well devil take it—you think the same of me as Aline does.","Oh was she?","A sickly conscience? What devilry is that?","Yes I'll tell you how that came about. One day this girl Kaia Fosli came to see them on some errand or other. She had never been here before. And when I saw how utterly infatuated they were with each other the thought occurred to me: if I cold only get her into the office here then perhaps Ragnar too would stay where he is.","Yes—yes—yes!","SOLNESS. —build it together with a princess whom I love—","Kaia don't you really care a little bit for Ragnar too?","Ah you are right there. Misfortune will have its way—as the saying goes.","Those women I can understand exceedingly well.","I know that he ventured that once in his life—one solitary time. It is a legend among us younger men. But no power on earth would induce him to do it again.","I cared very much for Ragnar once—before I came here to you.","What is it?","Yes—whatever you like.","Oh yes indeed he does.","Has she really?","Aline has become exceedingly shy with strangers of late years.","No nothing at all—on my side.","But I have seen him with my own eyes right up at the top of a high church-tower!","No. You are like a dawning day. When I look at you—I seem to be looking towards the sunrise.","High—high up by the vane! That is where you will see him!","Very well then I won't say it Halvard.","Why of the troll?","Indeed! Then where shall we see him?","Is she married?","What will you build next?","Not to be able to grasp at your own happiness—at your own life! Merely because some one you know happens to stand in the way!","I have no trunk.","Are they gone?","What castle?","H'm—I don't think I shall ever be of quite sound mind on that point.","The scaffolding is still up.","It is so! It is so! I know it!","Then take a little walk.","No one would suppose not.","To-day he will do it again!","Why good heavens! there is surely room for more than one single man—","Are there really? Still? You see I scarcely ever go there.","Isn't he?","No I suppose that you can't.","Never Mr. Solness—never has such a thought entered my mind.","I mean that your conscience is feeble—too delicately built as it were—hasn't strength to take a grip of things—to lift and bear what is heavy.","I have know it all along. Why do you ask me that?","Would it not be best for you to do that?","Yes it is and the ten years are gone. And you didn't come—as you had promised me.","This evening then we will hang up the wreath—Princess Hilda.","Very different yes. That's undeniable.","Yes I do indeed. If you are content to go about here teaching all these people—","I caught sight of you from over there.","But some ladies have just come to call on you—","Because you think that I——","Did you have a long talk with her?","You say I do.","Somebody wants me I hear.","May I stay here with you a little?","Three as there are here.","She said I might come and pay her a visit if ever I came up to town.","Oh at last!","If the house had been old Knut Brovik's it would never have burnt down so conveniently for him. I am sure of that for he does not know how to call for the helpers—no nor for the servers either.","Can you see any one else up there with him?","Perhaps you are thinking of studying here?","This is no home Halvard.","Oho! Original! Not the old-fashioned stuff that I am in the habit of turning out!","Who called for the helpers and servers? It was I! And they came and obeyed my will.","Oh first of all I want to go round and look at all the things that you have built.","Thank him when he has held me down year after year! When he made father disbelieve in me—made me disbelieve in myself! And all merely that he might—!","That is not true! You are telling falsehoods about him!","Yes do. Now Ragnar will have a chance of building for himself.","Only for that?","Does your wife dislike me very much?","You are the younger generation Hilda.","Yes I daresay. Well you must ask him to wait a little.","No thank you—I am not so mad as that.","Yes indeed you did. You took me in both your arms and bent my head back and kissed me—many times.","I merely wanted to tell you that Dr. Herdal is in the drawing-room. Won't you come and see him Halvard?","What is that one single thing Miss Wangel?","But the poor old man is lying at death's door! Can't you give him and his son this pleasure before they are parted? And perhaps he might get the commission to carry them out too.","And I have to go in!","So you know her too?","Why in all the world have we built it then? Can you tell me that?","Well that's the finishing touch if you have forgotten that too. I should have thought no one could help remembering such a thing as that.","It is not one's self alone that can do such great things. Oh no—the helpers and the servers—they must do their part too if it is to be of any good. But they never come of themselves. One has to call upon them very persistently—inwardly you understand.","They came to call upon you—and at the same time to ask whether you would mind retiring—","Since you don't believe that I am—ill—and crazy—and mad and so forth—","Happy? Do you say that too—like all the rest of them?","Well tell me now—if your wife can't endure this Kaia Fosli—?","I have indeed—especially of late years.","So I have seen him all through these ten years. How secure he stands! Frightfully thrilling all the same. Look at him! Now he is hanging the wreath round the vane!","I have noticed that as soon as you come you make her go.","Why do you always take that shade off when I come?","That I have got chilled through and through Mr. Solness.","Oh it is only something that—","Meanwhile I will go and see my patient.","I have not been systematically enough taught for that. Most of what I know I have found out for myself.","Well I wouldn't advise you to. For in a certain sense you see perhaps—perhaps she is not so far wrong in thinking something of the kind.","Have you looked at them?","What do you mean—?","If I try it Hilda I will stand up there and talk to him as I did that time before.","Then let me see you stand free and high up!","Very well.","Is it true what you said? Can I be of use to you?","Hilda shall sleep in the nursery she shall.","Why?","Well but do you not go down now and then to look at all the lovely things there?","Out with it then Mr. Solness.","Homes for human beings.","Is that mere fancy?","Get up! For goodness' sake get up! I think I hear some one.","Yes Mr. Solness.","I am sure that cannot have been my intention.","Retire from the agreement they meant.","Then it is true that you are afraid to do it?","There he is standing on the topmost planks! Right at the top!","Was there not one special thought that you—that you seized upon?","Ah that is exactly what I cannot help thinking about. And now at last I must speak about it too for I don't seem to be able to bear it any longer. And then never to be able to forgive myself—","What are we to look on at?","Well you know we were discussing your wife's intuition.","And why not a bird of prey? Why should not I go a-hunting—I as well as the rest? Carry off the prey I want—if only I can get my claws into it and do with it as I will.","He climbs and climbs. He will soon be at the top now.","There is nothing of the sort in here.","Neither trunk nor money then?","And tell him at the same time that henceforward I do not require his services—nor yours either.","Mad? Are there so many mad people here in town then?","Of course. First of all I suppose you want to make a round of the shops and get yourself up in the height of fashion.","Oh no—I understand the whole thing now. After this she would merely be—in the way.","Yes builders are such stupid people.","I am afraid I am disturbing you.","Yes of all the empty nurseries I slept in.","And the other thing? Say what that was!","Have you not noticed that yet?","Twins then.","She said that he had taken possession of her mind—her whole mind—centred all her thoughts upon himself alone. She says that she can never leave him—that she will remain here where he is—","First of all that grim old robbers' castle was burnt down for you. And that was certainly a great piece of luck.","Then what is all this nonsense you are talking about the crack in the chimney!","Are they pleased with the drawings? The people who will have to live in the house?","What should I want with him?","I mean—something that points—points up into the free air. With the vane at a dizzy height.","You are very easily frightened it seems!","I am not going to tell you.","Is it about him?","Well what was it?","Do you still feel their loss so much—after all these years?","Aline—you must promise me never to think these thoughts any more.—Promise me that dear!","Who else should there be?","But now if your wife—? Suppose with her delicate health all this tries her too much?","Yes I will! Right up there will I stand and look down on the other people—on those that are building churches and homes for mother and father and the troop of children. And you may come up and look on at it too.","Well is that you?","That she should not exactly approve of your seeing so much of another woman all day and every day.","Not for all the world. Not in your eyes.","Stay here with me Ragnar. You shall have everything your own way. And then you can marry Kaia and live at your ease—and happily too who knows? Only don't think of building on your own account.","May I have the drawings to take with me?","I am sure there will be no difficulty about that.","Yes the young couple who want a villa built out at Lovstrand.","What—?","I will not answer such a question. You must believe in me wholly and entirely!","Why not? Of course it need not have been an actual every-day sort of a kingdom.","She might have said she would do it because she had taken a tremendous fancy to me. She might have said something like that—something really warm and cordial you understand.","That's a good thing for her.","Well Mrs. Solness so you are sitting out here catching cold?","Poor Aline! I suppose it was about the little boys.","And at the very moment when you came—he let her go.","Yes yes yes devil take it! If that is to be the way of it—. Rather that than build away at random.","But need you have done that? For all time you say?","Will you not? That comes well from you.","Your husband told me.","And now you go home we don't require you to-day.","Yes. Suppose the fault was mine—in a certain sense.","Oh I seem to get worse every day.","And not about so many other things either.","Yes who else's daughter should I be?","I don't understand that.","I must go to him! I must get him to come down again!","Fancy their not wanting it!","Very far back.","But really I think I am quite fit to be seen in the streets—now that I've put my dress to rights. Or do you think I am not?","Me!","Her as well?","Had you a cosy happy home—up there with your father Hilda?","Not Kaia so much as Ragnar—he talks about it every day.","The smoke first. But when we came up to the garden gate the whole of the old timber-box was to be a rolling mass of flames.—That is how I wanted it to be you see.","Break it off. Are you mad? Would you think of breaking it off?","What have you seen?","Yes of course she was there.","What then? What will you build? Tell me at once!","Indeed? Robust eh? Is your own conscience robust may I ask?","But now I know so much for certain that I—","For I cannot get on without you you see. I must have you with me every single day.","Have you come to town this evening?","You! Is it you—yourself that your are talking about Aline?","And with my peace of soul into the bargain.","Then you must go ahead without them. There is nothing else for it.","It terrifies me—terrifies me every hour of the day. For sooner or later the luck must turn you see.","Do you wish to speak to Ragnar when he comes?","If it was a ruffian I had come to love—","I ought to be pleased for it is what Halvard wants—","On a firm foundation.","You said I was lovely in my white dress and that I looked like a little princess.","Oh yes—if only we could.","But you are wrong both you and the doctor. I am not in the state that you imagine.","My Master Builder.","Open the door?","Making fun of you perhaps? I too?","Do you mean just now when she was here?","Yes I think so. I have sent for him at any rate.","It must have been terribly hard for you.","Thanks.","How so?","And now I shall never—never build anything of that sort again! Neither churches nor church-towers.","Yes to be sure. It must have been the same afternoon for I left the place next morning.","Oh no uncle—do wait awhile before doing that!","I think you might at least have thanked him","Poor Mr. Solness! And you have gone all these ten years—and staked your whole life—on that alone.","Her duty?","Now I can see both the garden and you Mr. Solness. So now tell away! Begin!","May I have a few words with you?","Is this the first time you have ever been up to town Miss Wangel?","Oh you should just have seen him high high up—at the dizzy height where I once saw him.","You should have thought of that before. It is too late now. So—","Then have you nothing to say to me about what happened up there?","Do you draw your legs up under you while you are falling?","That new house you mean?","He can have the building of that villa out at Lovstrand.","That must have been thrilling.","I had not put them by. The dolls and I had gone on living together.","What's that? Did you not hear something?","No it's my book-keeper.","O how can you say so Halvard? Why you can't even bear to go out on the second-storey balcony here. You have always been like that.","The impossible?","Oh dear oh dear—I am sure Mrs. Solness thinks ill of me in some way!","His will yes that I can easily believe. But he simply cannot do it. His head would swim round long long before he got half-way. He would have to crawl down again on his hands and knees.","And I venture to say that I built those poor little churches with such honest and warm and heartfelt devotion that—that—","Or—! Wait a moment! There is something under all this you may depend!","I'll go out to look at that tower first thing to-morrow morning.","Very well. Now let us two sit down here Mr. Solness.","Is she still asleep?","I will be sure to. Good-night Mrs. Solness.","And then—?","The home that used to be father's and mother's—and that was burnt to the ground—","An arrangement? What about?","Both old and new.","Kaia—I believe.","Then do you hear no song in the air either?","Yes you say that. And yet you go away from me—leave me alone here with everything on my hands.","Yes I have.","To be carried off.","What a girl you are!","But afterwards his turn came.","I must have an answer to this one question. Am I to pass out of life in such utter poverty?","Have you been round the garden Miss Wangel?","No I don't think there is much amiss with your intellect.","H'm—I confess I have forgotten the particular day. I only know it was ten years ago. Some time in autumn.","Can't you ask the ladies to go away?","Yes it was horribly ugly—and hard and bad and cruel as well.","Yes. One with a firm foundation under it.","Miss Wangel has this moment arrived and she would like to stay the night here.","Why what are you talking about? What is it?","Ill! You! She has never hinted such a thing to me. Why what can she think is the matter with you?","In one sense it's a relief as well.","Pooh—these scrawlings! But if he has been learning from you—"],
