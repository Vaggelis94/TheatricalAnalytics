In front on the right a console table  with a large mirror over it.  Well-filled stands of plants  and flowers.  In front on the left a sofa with a table  and chairs.  Further back a bookcase.  Well forward in the  room before the bay window a small table and some chairs.  It is early in the day.  SOLNESS sits by the little table with RAGNAR BROVIK'S  portfolio open in front of him.

At the back from the end of the verandah a flight of steps  leads down to the garden below.  Tall old trees in the  garden spread their branches over the verandah and towards  the house.  Far to the right in among the trees a glimpse  is caught of the lower part of the new villa with scaffolding  round so much as is seen of the tower.  In the background  the garden is bounded by an old wooden fence.  Outside the  fence a street with low tumble-down cottages.  Evening sky with sun-lit clouds.  On the verandah a garden bench stands along the wall of the  house and in front of the bench a long table.  On the other  side of the table an arm-chair and some stools.  All the  furniture is of wicker-work.  MRS. SOLNESS wrapped in a large white crepe shawl sits  resting in the arm-chair and gazes over to the right.
